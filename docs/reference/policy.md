# Policy YAML reference

A **policy file** (`.maida/policy.yaml`) lets teams check assertion thresholds into version control so that `maida run` and `maida assert` apply consistent checks without long CLI flags.

---

## Resolution order

`maida run` and `maida assert` resolve the policy in this order:

1. **`--policy PATH`** flag on the CLI (explicit path)
2. **`.maida/policy.yaml`** in the current working directory (auto-detected)
3. **Empty policy** (all checks disabled)

CLI flags (`--max-steps`, `--no-loops`, etc.) are then merged on top. CLI values always win over the file — see [Override rules](#override-rules) below.

---

## File structure

The file is standard YAML. The policy loader reads a single top-level `assert:` mapping; all other top-level keys are ignored. Unknown keys inside `assert:` are also ignored.

```yaml
# .maida/policy.yaml
assert:
  # ... assertion fields go here ...
```

Requires **PyYAML** (`pip install pyyaml` or included in `maida[yaml]`). If PyYAML is not installed, `maida assert --policy ...` raises a clear `RuntimeError`.

---

## Assertion fields

All fields are optional. A check is **disabled** unless at least one relevant value is set (via baseline, policy file, or CLI flag).

### Statistical gate settings

These fields control repeated execution by `maida run`. They live in the same
`assert:` mapping as the checks they aggregate.

| YAML key | Type | Default | CLI flag | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `trials` | `int` | `3` | `--trials` | Number of isolated agent executions |
| `confidence_level` | `float` | `0.95` | `--confidence-level` | Confidence level for the two-sided Wilson interval |
| `pass_rate_threshold` | `float` | `0.90` | `--pass-rate-threshold` | Minimum acceptable pass rate for each check |

The defaults intentionally keep the first gate quick. At `N=1`, Maida uses the
single trial as a binary decision. At `N=3`, unanimous outcomes decide the
verdict while mixed outcomes use the Wilson interval. This small-sample rule is
a temporary compatibility policy; use more trials when stronger evidence is
worth the added execution cost and CI latency.

### Numeric thresholds

| YAML key | Type | Default | CLI flag | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `max_steps` | `int` or `null` | `null` | `--max-steps` | Hard cap on total event count |
| `step_tolerance` | `float` | `0.5` | `--step-tolerance` | Fractional tolerance for step count when comparing against a baseline |
| `max_tool_calls` | `int` or `null` | `null` | `--max-tool-calls` | Hard cap on tool call count |
| `tool_call_tolerance` | `float` | `0.5` | `--tool-call-tolerance` | Fractional tolerance for tool calls |
| `max_cost_tokens` | `int` or `null` | `null` | `--max-cost-tokens` | Hard cap on total token count |
| `cost_tolerance` | `float` | `0.5` | `--cost-tolerance` | Fractional tolerance for token cost |
| `max_duration_ms` | `int` or `null` | `null` | `--max-duration-ms` | Hard cap on run duration in milliseconds |
| `duration_tolerance` | `float` | `0.5` | `--duration-tolerance` | Fractional tolerance for duration |

### Boolean checks

| YAML key | Type | Default | CLI flag | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `no_new_tools` | `bool` | `false` | `--no-new-tools` | Fail if the run uses tools not present in the baseline |
| `no_loops` | `bool` | `false` | `--no-loops` | Fail if any `LOOP_WARNING` event was emitted |
| `no_guardrails` | `bool` | `false` | `--no-guardrails` | Fail if any guardrail event was triggered |

### Status check

| YAML key | Type | Default | CLI flag | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `expect_status` | `string` or `null` | `null` | `--expect-status` | Expected run status: `"ok"` or `"error"` |

---

## How thresholds work

Tolerances are **fractional**, not percentage: `0.5` means 50%, `0.2` means 20%.

For each numeric metric (steps, tool calls, tokens, duration), the check depends on what is available:

| Baseline provided? | `max_*` set? | Effective limit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Yes | Yes | `min(baseline * (1 + tolerance), max_*)` | Baseline-relative with a hard cap |
| Yes | No | `baseline * (1 + tolerance)` | Baseline-relative only |
| No | Yes | `max_*` | Hard cap only |
| No | No | *(check disabled)* | Nothing to compare against |

The check **passes** when `actual <= limit`.

When a baseline value is zero and a matching `max_*` cap is set, Maida uses
the cap as the effective limit. Without a cap, a zero baseline allows no growth
for that metric.

**Example:** A baseline recorded 40 tool calls. With `tool_call_tolerance: 0.25` and `max_tool_calls: 60`:

- Baseline limit: `40 * 1.25 = 50`
- Hard cap: `60`
- Effective limit: `min(50, 60) = 50`
- A run with 48 tool calls passes; a run with 52 fails.

---

## Override rules

When `maida run` or `maida assert` loads a policy file and also receives CLI flags, the policy merge applies these rules:

- A CLI value of `None` (flag not provided) keeps the file value.
- A CLI boolean value of `False` (flag not provided) keeps the file value. Only an explicit `--no-loops` (which sends `True`) overrides.
- Any other non-`None` CLI value replaces the file value.

This means you can set baseline thresholds in the committed policy file and tighten or loosen individual checks on a per-invocation basis:

```bash
# File sets no_loops: true, step_tolerance: 0.3
# CLI overrides max_steps for this specific run
maida assert abc123 --max-steps 100
```

`maida run` also accepts direct overrides for all three statistical fields:

```bash
maida run path/to/agent.py \
  --trials 30 \
  --confidence-level 0.99 \
  --pass-rate-threshold 0.95
```

## Full examples

### Starter policy

```yaml
# .maida/policy.yaml - generated by `maida init`
assert:
  # Statistical gate defaults.
  trials: 3
  confidence_level: 0.95
  pass_rate_threshold: 0.90

  # Allowed growth vs baseline (0.5 = +50%).
  step_tolerance: 0.5
  tool_call_tolerance: 0.5
  cost_tolerance: 0.5
  duration_tolerance: 0.5

  # Strict checks (uncomment to opt in):
  # no_loops: true
  # no_guardrails: true
  # no_new_tools: true
  # expect_status: ok
```

The starter policy is forgiving on purpose. It only applies numeric tolerance
checks when a baseline is provided. Without a baseline, those checks have
nothing to compare against. Strict behavior, such as failing on any loop warning
or any new tool, requires uncommenting the relevant rule or passing the matching
CLI flag.

### Lenient local policy

Use this archetype while iterating locally. It keeps the baseline-relative
tolerances from the starter policy and avoids strict checks until you opt in.

```yaml
# .maida/policy.yaml - for local iteration
assert:
  trials: 3
  confidence_level: 0.95
  pass_rate_threshold: 0.90

  step_tolerance: 0.5
  tool_call_tolerance: 0.5
  cost_tolerance: 0.5
  duration_tolerance: 0.5

  # Optional local sanity checks:
  # no_loops: true
  # expect_status: ok
```

### Strict CI policy

```yaml
# .maida/policy.yaml - checked into the repo
assert:
  trials: 30
  confidence_level: 0.95
  pass_rate_threshold: 0.90
  max_steps: 80
  step_tolerance: 0.2
  max_tool_calls: 30
  tool_call_tolerance: 0.2
  max_cost_tokens: 10000
  cost_tolerance: 0.1
  max_duration_ms: 30000
  duration_tolerance: 0.2
  no_new_tools: true
  no_loops: true
  no_guardrails: true
  expect_status: ok
```

### Passing example

Baseline summary:

```json
{ "total_events": 100, "tool_calls": 20, "total_tokens": 1000, "duration_ms": 10000 }
```

Current run summary:

```json
{ "total_events": 140, "tool_calls": 25, "total_tokens": 1200, "duration_ms": 11000 }
```

With the starter policy, this passes: each numeric value is within the 50%
baseline tolerance, and no strict checks are enabled.

### Failing example

Baseline tools:

```json
["search", "summarize"]
```

Current run tools:

```json
["search", "summarize", "refund_customer"]
```

With `no_new_tools: true` uncommented, this fails because `refund_customer` was
not present in the baseline.
